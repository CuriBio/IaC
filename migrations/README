To create a new revision script file:
    run: alembic revision -m "basic description for migration"

Locate new revision file in ~/migrations/versions: %%(revision_id)s_%%(basic_description_for_migration)s

Make desired modifications to these methods:

    def upgrade():
        TODO: additions/altering

    def downgrade():
        TODO: deletions

Update description to include "Revision by: {name}"

Workflow is set to call upgrade HEAD in selected workspace, but can be modified manually before running migration in ~/.github/scripts/run_migrations.sh
